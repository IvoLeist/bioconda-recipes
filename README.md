If you need to use a CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) module in your conda environment,
you can include it in your build and run requirements by following similar steps to those outlined previously.
However, you must create a conda package for your CPAN module first if it doesn't exist already.

Create a conda recipe for your CPAN module
A conda recipe for a CPAN module will include a meta.yaml file and potentially a build.sh script.
The meta.yaml file provides metadata about the package and its dependencies,
and the build.sh script contains the commands to build the module.

conda build perl-convert-pheno
bioconda-utils build --docker --mulled-test --git-range master --packages perl-convert-pheno

Include the CPAN module as a dependency in your Python conda package
Now you can include perl-convert-pheno as a dependency in your meta.yaml file for your Python conda package.

```
requirements:
	build:
		- python
		- setuptools
		- perl
		- perl-convert-pheno

	run:
		- python
		- perl
		- perl-convert-pheno
```
